# Self Service Speed Post Kiosk
To “Modernize” the post office the self-service speed post (kiosk) program is a big step. The first thing that comes to mind when folks think of going to a post office and post its letter is that they have to stand in a long queue and fill up all the information about himself and the one whom he/she is sending the post.   We have developed a solution of self-service speed post in which the person does not have to stand in any queue he/she can do all the post stuff by themselves with the help of the software.They just have to visit the post office and use the machine for speed post like they use the Atm machine with simple instruction.  With the help of these simple steps to send our post, we can easily save our time.The term ‘Self Service Speed Post' today applies to the next level of modernization for the speed post services.
